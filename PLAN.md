# Implementation Plan: Next.js Ecommerce Prototype

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation approach for building a UI-only ecommerce prototype using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project will showcase a complete shopping flow from product browsing to order confirmation, with all data served from mock APIs.

## High-Level Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (PHASE-1-FOUNDATION.md)
**Objective:** Set up core infrastructure, design system, and data layer
- Install and configure dependencies (shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod)
- Set up design tokens and theme configuration
- Create TypeScript type definitions
- Implement mock API with seeded data
- Set up project structure

### Phase 2: State Management & Cart (PHASE-2-STATE.md)
**Objective:** Build cart functionality and state management
- Implement CartProvider with Context + useReducer
- Add localStorage synchronization
- Create cart-related components
- Build header with cart badge
- Implement cart operations (add, remove, update quantity)

### Phase 3: Product Catalog & Detail Pages (PHASE-3-PRODUCTS.md)
**Objective:** Create product browsing experience
- Build inventory grid page (/)
- Implement ProductCard component
- Create product detail page with options
- Add loading skeletons
- Implement "quick add" and detailed add-to-cart flows

### Phase 4: Cart & Checkout Flow (PHASE-4-CHECKOUT.md)
**Objective:** Complete purchase flow
- Build cart page with line items
- Create checkout form with validation
- Implement order summary components
- Add shipping calculations
- Handle form submission and order creation

### Phase 5: Order Confirmation & Polish (PHASE-5-POLISH.md)
**Objective:** Finalize user experience
- Create order confirmation page
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Implement toast notifications
- Create empty states
- Add animations and transitions
- Final accessibility audit

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Next.js App Router** for modern React patterns
- **Server Components** for static content (product lists, page shells)
- **Client Components** for interactivity (cart, forms)
- **Context + useReducer** for cart state management
- **localStorage** for cart persistence

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom design tokens
- **shadcn/ui** for consistent component library
- **8pt spacing grid** for layout consistency
- **Minimal color palette**: white/stone backgrounds, slate text, teal accents

### Data Management
- **Mock API** with simulated latency (200-600ms)
- **5% random error rate** for realistic error handling
- **In-memory data** seeded from static files
- **No real backend** - purely frontend demonstration

## Success Criteria
1. Complete user flow from product browsing to order confirmation
2. Responsive design matching reference aesthetics
3. Proper error handling and loading states
4. Cart persistence across page navigations
5. Form validation with helpful error messages
6. WCAG AA accessibility compliance
7. Clean, maintainable code structure

## Dependencies to Install
- shadcn/ui (component library)
- react-hook-form (form management)
- zod (validation schemas)
- Additional shadcn components as needed

## Development Approach
1. **Agent-First Development**: Leverage specialized sub-agents for parallel implementation
2. **Design Compliance**: Strict adherence to design.md specifications
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with no 'any' types
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, then polish
5. **Test-Driven**: Implement with testing in mind (though minimal tests for prototype)

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 hours)
- Phase 2: State Management (2-3 hours)
- Phase 3: Product Pages (3-4 hours)
- Phase 4: Checkout Flow (3-4 hours)
- Phase 5: Polish (2-3 hours)

Total: ~12-17 hours of focused development
